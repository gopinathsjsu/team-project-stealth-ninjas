## XP Values
### Feedback ###

Since the beginning of the project, we've taken feedback on one's indivisual work from all the others in our team which made each one us to suggest any changes if necessary. This constant validation has helped us to understand the functionality in different perspectives. Code has been committed to master after only proper review and feedback from the team.

### Simplicity ###

We were always focusing on what's been asked as we wanted to keep it simple and make sure that the basic requirements of the project are met first, only then we planned of adding any other additional APIs.

### Communication ###

Communication has always been the key factor in our team. We had scrum calls twice a week on every thursdays and saturdays which made sure that all of us were making progress in each sprint. We used to discuss what was supposed to be done in that particular sprint and prioritizing the tasks helped us in joining all the pieces of the project easily.
